Following are operations defined for mutable sequences.
These wont work on immutable types like ranges, tuples ore strings

s[i] = x => item i of s is replaced by x	 
s[i:j] = t => slice of s from i to j is replaced by the contents of the iterable t	 
del s[i:j] => same as s[i:j] = []	 
s[i:j:k] = t => the elements of s[i:j:k] are replaced by those of t
del s[i:j:k] => removes the elements of s[i:j:k] from the list	 
s.append(x) => appends x to the end of the sequence (same as s[len(s):len(s)] = [x])	 
s.clear() => removes all items from s (same as del s[:])
s.copy() => creates a shallow copy of s (same as s[:])
s.extend(t) or s += t	=> extends s with the contents of t (for the most part the same as s[len(s):len(s)] = t)	 
s *= n	=> updates s with its contents repeated n times
s.insert(i, x)	=> inserts x into s at the index given by i (same as s[i:i] = [x])	 
s.pop([i])	=> retrieves the item at i and also removes it from s
s.remove(x)	=> remove the first item from s where s[i] is equal to x
s.reverse()	=> reverses the items of s in place
"""

"""
NOTES:
1. When using:
  >> a[i:j:k] = t
to replace elements, t should be the same size as the slice

2. The value n is an integer, or an object implementing __index__(). Zero and negative values of n clear the sequence. 
Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced multiple times.
